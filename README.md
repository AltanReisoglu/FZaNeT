# FZA-Net Anomaly Detection System

This project is a Python application that performs anomaly detection using the FZA-Net architecture. It is specifically designed for industrial visual inspection and quality control scenarios. The model processes a given image using pre-trained weights to produce anomaly scores or detections.



## About the Project

This application utilizes a PyTorch-based FZA-Net model for anomaly detection. The goal is to automatically identify anomalous regions or conditions that deviate from standard (normal) samples. 

```bash
python main.py --image_path "images/instance.png"
